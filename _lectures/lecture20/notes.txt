The errors that cause the exceptions on the back are:
- Looking up parts[1] instead of parts[0] when looking for rectangle
- The extra space in regions2.txt between 5 and 6

Note that there is also a messed up formatting in regions1.txt â€“ that's
deliberate. That line actually does not cause an error. This is because while
parts will be quite long, it won't cause an out of bounds access. That said, the
extra rectangle  bit won't be included.

The first error is interesting because a null is produced but doesn't cause an
error until much later. This is a cautionary tale about return null and also a
good example of thinking about what this must look like in memory. Also, we
could do something more explicit in that null case and throw some meaningful
exception that we choose, or even just print an error message.

The second is interesting because we could either try to fix the program or try
to fix the input file. I don't think it's worth trying to fix the program here,
though we could report a more meaningful error.

If there's time left, you can try to make it work if there are extra spaces, but
that's actually pretty annoying with what we know right now, so just a
high-level discussion of it could be useful.
